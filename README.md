## Triangle Check

This program is used to determine the feasibility of forming a triangle with three given integer values. The program should return True if a valid triangle can be formed based on the trianle inequality theorem , and false otherwise

## User Story

As a Builder, I want a program that can determine whether three given integer values represent the sides of a valid triangle. This will help me quickly assess if a set of values can form a geometrically valid triangle, following the triangle inequality theorem
